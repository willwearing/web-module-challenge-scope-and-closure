### Task 3 - Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, **create** a new file called `stretch.js` and practice more with closures. There are no tests for these problems.

See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions

```js
(function () {
  var a = (b = 3);
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== "undefined"));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== "undefined"));
```

// 1st console log would be false, 2nd would be true.

2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).

```js
var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); // returns 16
addSix(21); // returns 27
```
function createBase(baseNum) {
    return function (n) {
        return baseNum + n;
    } 
}

var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10);

3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming.Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object - oriented programming.This is a common interview question and great practice!
